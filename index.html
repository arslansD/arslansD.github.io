            <h2></h2>
            <p style="color:black">‘I’m tired of being what you want me to be, feeling so faithless, lost under the surface…’ If any doubts remained that Linkin Park were here to say, the third single from Meteora (and the closing statement on the record itself) was resounding proof that they were to be the enduring voice of this generation. Indeed, only more so as they were able to express themselves on their own varied terms. Despite Numb being a mega-hit in itself, the band’s 2004 Collision Course collaboration (Numb/Encore) with New York rap royalty Jay-Z eclipsed its profile in the mainstream consciousness. We reckon, however, that the song is best experienced on its own relatively stripped back steam (even the version featuring Chester’s isolated vocals is enough to raise chills). The legion of fans who made it the most-watched rock music video in YouTube history (toppling Guns N’ Roses’ venerable November Rain last year) would tend to agree.

          <h3 style="color:white">IN THE END (HYBRID THEORY, 2000)</h3>

          <h2></h2>
          <p style="color:black">The story goes that Chester Bennington didn’t want In The End to make the final cut of Hybrid Theory. A slower, more expansive, piano-driven composition – albeit one littered with lung-busting power choruses – it didn’t obviously fit the harder edges wrapped around it. Becoming the album’s fourth single, however, it became the first to truly foreshadow their enormous mainstream-busting potential. Featuring one of Chester’s most iconic, exposed vocal performances (‘I’ve put my trust in you / Pushed as far as I can go…’) and accompanied by a surrealist music video that (at the time of writing) is on the cusp of a billion views on YouTube, it has doubtless earned immortality.

          <h2></h2>
          <p style="color:black">
          The lead single from Minutes To Midnight was a forthright goodbye to their nu-metal roots. (‘In this farewell, there is no blood, there is no alibi…’) Guided by legendary producer Rick Rubin, the band build over a beguiling piano riff, with a rawer performance fixated not on vocal interplay, but on the bare quality of Bennington’s delivery. Critics at the time saw it as a move away from metal altogether, in pursuit of the more middle-of-the-road mainstream appeal of outfits like U2 now that the initial subgenre bubble had burst. With the benefit of hindsight, its easier to understand it as an evolutionary step from a band with the daring to leave behind a formula with which they had conquered the world – and continued to win.</p>
